## Installation and Setup Instructions

#### Example:  

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`

`npm start`

To Visit App:

## Usage

The app currently consists of a landing page to redirect to both a signup or login page. Users can then create an account, or use an existing account to start uploading images. The image uploader uses a simple dropzone component to drag/drop files or insert files from the file explorer. In the friends page, one can search for users and add them as friends. If the user is currently following another user, they will be able to see that individual's image gallery.
